summary: "This study analyzes the influence of household members’ job quality on the household poverty status in
Côte d'Ivoire using data from the 2018 Harmonized Survey of Household Living Conditions. Using simple
probit regressions, this study highlights the significant negative effect of a household head’s job quality on
household poverty risk. It also shows that improving the job quality of other household members reduces
the risk of household poverty. In addition to promoting improved employment conditions for workers,
policymakers should promote women's access to high-quality jobs. This could involve investing in social
facilities to relieve the burden of caring for children in the household."

##### Abstract

This study analyzes the influence of household members’ job quality on the household poverty status in
Côte d'Ivoire using data from the 2018 Harmonized Survey of Household Living Conditions. Using simple
probit regressions, this study highlights the significant negative effect of a household head’s job quality on
household poverty risk. It also shows that improving the job quality of other household members reduces
the risk of household poverty. In addition to promoting improved employment conditions for workers,
policymakers should promote women's access to high-quality jobs. This could involve investing in social
facilities to relieve the burden of caring for children in the household.
